# Deep-Learning
Projects related to Deep Learning concepts in Pytorch

The project includes the 
1. Popular resnet Deep Learning framework. The ResNet is implemented using Pytorch 1.7.0 and CUDA 11.0 wiith CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Dual Path Network implementation, a combination of bottleneck version of Resnet and DenseNet. It is implemented in PyTorch 1.7.0 and CUDA 11.0 and trained on CIFAR-10 dataset. It was developed for image classifiication into 10 different classes/labels.
